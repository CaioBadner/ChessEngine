# ChessEngine

OVERVIEW
This is the beginning of a passion project of mine, making my own chess engine. 
I started this when I did my JAVA course back in 2019 but it still remains unfinished. 
The idea was to first make a normal chess game and then develop a working AI that would be improved over time.

FEATURES
So far all I got are the basic classes for the board, tiles and pieces and all the basic legal moves for each piece. 
There is a lot of work to be done, so I welcome anyone who would be interested in participating :)
